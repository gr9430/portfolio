### Glenn S. Ritchey III

I'm a PhD student, teacher, and artist investigating how communities resist cultural and technological colonization. My work asks: Who gets to make meaning and why? How do we democratize this process?

This question animates my research in decolonial aesthetics (focusing on critical intercultural solidarities with Kashmir and Northern Ireland as my focus), my creative practice in generative literature and critical making, and my teaching in composition and digital literacies.

I'm a first-year doctoral student in the Texts & Technology program at UCF, where I explore the intersections of:

- __Decolonial and postcolonial theory__
How do occupied communities use visual and digital culture to resist dominant narratives?

- __Algorithmic creativity and democratic technology__ 
Who controls the tools that shape language, and how can we build alternatives?

- __Critical making and open-source practice__
What does it mean to create art and scholarship using accessible, non-commercial tools?

My work focuses on how digital environments shape communication practices, from social media narratives to multimodal composition. I’m especially interested in questions like:

- How do digital platforms transform what it means to “write”?
- What new literacies emerge in online, interactive, or algorithmic spaces?
- How can we teach writing that prepares students for a post-print world?
