## Place-Based Projects

### Baking 
(Performance; 2023 – Ongoing)

Inspired by the work of Bill Drummond, this project explored critical making, community orature, and ephemeral cultural practices through baking scones and making jam upon request. Over the course of 2023, individuals could request scones and jam with a month's notice, at no cost. Centered around sharing food, the gatherings emphasized oral storytelling and embodied cultural transmission, recalling traditions of orature where cultural memory and social bonds are formed through direct, personal interaction.

By positioning baking as performance and food preparation as composition, the project bridged theories of composition studies, Old Irish oral traditions, and decolonial practice, critiquing digital dependency and commodification. Like Drummond's work, it prioritized process over product, fostering communal presence and relationality over mediated interaction.

Managed all aspects of production, from sourcing ingredients to coordinating requests and facilitating gatherings, with scones and jam distributed exclusively during in-person events.

### Marie, Mon Amour
Self-released, limited VHS run, 2018.

An experimental short film combining iPhone footage with distorted B-film clips, inspired by 1980s direct-to-video thrillers and avant-garde filmmakers such as Dietmar Brehm, Cecilia Condit, Marguerite Duras, and Alain Robbe-Grillet. The film follows a memory in an off-season beach town searching for a lost lover, with intercut cemetery footage implying a mysterious murder.

#### Screenings
- Manes Emporium of Doubt, October 28, 2018. _Invited_.

- Cinematique Theater, 2019 — during the COVID-19 lockdown as a conceptual installation for an empty audience. _Instigated_.

### Independent Publications, as Self
#### _Lebor II_
Self-published as Lebor Publications, limited pamphlet run, July 2023.

Limited-edition pamphlet featuring fragmented experimental writing and abstract storytelling, described as "the first part of a two-part exorcism, presented in reverse order." It blends chaotic temporal loops, decaying structures, and surreal postmodern landscapes with gothic minimalism and blending of Central Scots. Written, edited, and designed by Glenn S. Ritchey III. Managed all aspects of production, from content to exclusive distribution at Topos Bookstore, Brooklyn, NY.

#### _Lebor I_
Self-published as Lebor Publications, limited pamphlet run, June 2023.

Limited-edition pamphlet featuring experimental writing and object design, published to incite new ideas and retire old ones. Described as "an unmixed, unmastered, non-existing dance mix single with a bloated preamble," it blends conceptual critique with farcical reflection. Written, edited, and designed by Glenn S. Ritchey III, with implementation of the custom typeface Amalgam by Benjamin Tuttle. Managed all aspects of production, from content to exclusive distribution at Topos Bookstore, Brooklyn, NY.

### Publications, as AWG INC
#### "Vacances de Printemps sans Mon Amour." 
_SR50 Magazine_, December 2019.

A farcical meditation on writing that blends genre disruption with surreal imagery. Drawing on Marguerite Duras and Alain Robbe-Grillet's narrative techniques, the story reimagines the Beach Party series as an abstract, de-facto slasher, subverting genre conventions and audience expectations in arts and culture media.

#### "M. Accelerated: A Deconstruction of the 'Spaghetti Western' and Failed Cinema."

_Pallor Pink Vol. 6: This Ain't My First Rodeo_, November 2019. [[link]](https://yewonkwon.com/PP-COWBOYS)

A genre deconstruction reimagining the spaghetti western through the fragmented narrative style of Marguerite Duras and the iconic imagery of Sergio Leone. The work juxtaposes surreal visuals with reflective text, exploring the tension between genre conventions and personal, process-driven creation.
